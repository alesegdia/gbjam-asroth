One day, the Lord of Hell, decides to bring fate to their opposites at Heaven, and Asroth is in in the middle of the dark side travel to the uplands.

## Game guide

In order to pass through the game stages, you have to get **crosses** to be able to travel through dimensions. These can be obtained from **demons** and **summoners**. The game is hard for starters, but if you manage your way to get some better weapons, you can pass through it relatively easy. When you have enough crosses, you can go to the next level by using the portal near the place where you spawn. You can know how many more crosses you need to be able to travel there.

The first weapon you should get is the **sinegun** for 3 coins. With this weapon, you can kill ground enemies easily by standing in a platform away from them, because of the wave pattern of this gun. It's not too much powerfull, but it has trespassing.

Shopkeepers have a chance to refill their stock when you buy from them, so it's recommended to not hit them and farm with the summoners to get the more powerfull you can each level. The best weapon imho, is the **sacred punch**, with short range but trespassing and high damage. With this one, you can dispatch demons relatively easy.

Also, I would encourage you can get **smash number** and **smash power** upgrades from the shop to enhance the **ground smashing** ability.
